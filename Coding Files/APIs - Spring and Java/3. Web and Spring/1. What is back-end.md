## Web Server
Front end client requests info about website, needs files to load the page. Web servers handle the request and transmit file request data.
	Dynamic websites continuously change (Twitter live feeds, etc)
	Static websites are stationary and are typically not updated daily (Wikipedia)

## Back-end
Back-end programs dictate what, how, and where files are sent and how they are displayed for the web client. The server might transmit the same files for everyone, but there are certain customizations for users (sign in page, recent history, shopping cart) that require more dynamic content to be customized and personalized for each user.

## Storing the data
Relational Databases - SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
Non-relational databases - NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)
	Backend engineers need to be able to access, change, and analyze data stored 

## **A**pplication **P**rogram **I**nterface (API)
Creating, reading, updating, deleting
Web APIs are designed for interacting with a web application's data, often through HTTP request-response cycles.
This request specifies whether it is creating, reading, updating, deleting
	Receives data back as a response

## Authorization and Authentication
Authentication is when you validate the identity of a user
	typically usernames, passwords - stored in a database (securely)

Authorization - how much a user can access on a site or application (user profile edit page, menus for deleting a post)

Back end requires both

## Stacks
back end frameworks to use collections of tools to shape the organization of a backend environment

## HypterText Transfer Protocol HTTP & Transmission Control Protocol TCP
Using HTTP,  requests and responses are made throughout the internet. HTTP is the command language that devices on both sides of the TCP internet connection must follow.
	- access codecademy.com
	- browser commanded to open a TCP channel to the server that responds at the URL
	- the TCP connection is established 
	- client sends an HTTP GET request to the server to retrieve the webpage 
	- The server sends a response
	- TCP connection closes
